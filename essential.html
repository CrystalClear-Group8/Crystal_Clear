		<p><h6>1. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element" target="_blank">Carbon (C)</a>.</p>Carbon is in every living thing and acts like the building blocks of life. It's found in things like our food, the air we breathe, and even in our bodies. Without carbon, plants, animals, and humans wouldn't be able to exist.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>2. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrogen" target="_blank">Hydrogen (H)</a>.</p>Hydrogen is a part of water, which all living things need to survive. It helps keep our bodies hydrated and is important for many chemical reactions in our cells. Plants also need hydrogen to make food through a process called photosynthesis.</p>
		<hr />
		<p> 3. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen" target="_blank">Oxygen (O)</a>.</p>Oxygen is what we breathe in to stay alive and is also a part of water. It helps our cells get the energy they need to function. Most living things, including humans and animals, would not survive without oxygen.</p>
		<hr />
		<p> 4. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nitrogen" target="_blank">Nitrogen (N)</a>.</p>Nitrogen is important for making proteins, which help us grow and repair our muscles. It is found in the air and is taken up by plants from the soil. Without nitrogen, plants couldn't grow properly, and we wouldn't have the proteins we need to stay healthy.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>5. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/phosphorus-chemical-element" target="_blank">Phosphorus (P)</a>.</p>Phosphorus is essential for strong bones and teeth and is found in our DNA, the instruction manual for our bodies. It also helps cells store and use energy. Plants need phosphorus to grow seeds and fruits, which are important for reproduction.</p>
		<hr />
		<p> 6. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sulfur" target="_blank">Sulfur (S)</a></p>Sulfur helps make some vitamins and proteins and is important for healthy skin, hair, and nails. It also helps protect plants from diseases and pests. Without sulfur, our bodies wouldn't function properly, and plants wouldn't be as healthy.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>7. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/calcium" target="_blank">Calcium (Ca)</a>.</p>Calcium is crucial for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. It also helps our muscles work properly and our blood to clot when we get a cut. Without enough calcium, our bones can become weak and fragile, leading to problems like osteoporosis.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>8. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/potassium" target="_blank">Potassium (K)</a>.</p>Potassium is essential for keeping our nerves and muscles functioning well. It helps regulate the balance of fluids in our body and supports proper heart function. A lack of potassium can cause muscle weakness, cramps, and even heart problems.</p><br />
